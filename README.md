# Hosting your resume on GitHub pages

## Purpose
The aim of this document is to provide the reader with a tutorial on how one can upload their resume on GitHub Pages using a Markdown editor and Jekyll. These changes will be made by utilizing the principals in the *Modern Technical Writing* by Andrew Etter. 

## Prerequisites
Before we get started with uploading and styling our GitHub Page, we need to know how to use GitHub Flavored Markdown and Jekyll. The knowledge to use both of these technologies are provided with a link in the More Resources section of this document.


## Instructions
This section provides an end to end, detailed steps on how one can upload their resume on GitHub Pages.

### Getting Started with the basics  
1.	Log in or Create your GitHub account, then Create a repository

### Changing the Settings     
3.	Navigate to the settings page and Scroll down until you see the “GitHub Pages” section as shown below. Under the source tab, set the branch settings to Main and then click on “Save” to update your settings.    
### Choosing a Theme    
4.	 Now click on “Choose a theme” which will redirect you to a new Page. At the top half of the Page we are going to navigate the carousel until we get to the “Tactile” theme and click the button Select Theme, you will then be redirected to     
### Creating the index file  
5.	Now we are presented with the following screen which prompts to show a new file and we are going to rename it to “index.md.” This will be the index file in our repository which will store our resume for viewing. Below in the editor we can see a template file which shows the features provided with a Markdown File. You can make your necessary changes and click on Make changes to update the file.

## FAQ's
Why is Markdown better than a word processor?  
Although Microsoft Word is a fantastic application for the end user, but any aspiring programmer should take the initiative to look into Markdown as it is a great tool to publish Documentation which can be updated on most devices. Markdown has many advantages over Word some being ___ and ___. These advantages aid the programmer to produce some documentation to maintain its lifespan, since the editor can make changes on the fly and eliminates the need for the end user to download a disposable copy which are considered as waste since they are disposable. 
 
Why are we using  LML as opposed to HTML?  
A lightweight Markup Language (LML) is a type of language which was originally meant to augment HTML and its main focus was to encourage developers to produce documentation for their projects. Overall Markdown is very simple and requires almost no coding knowledge. In our tutorial we are going to use StackEdit which is an online live Markdown editor where one can make their changes and view them live, the other reason why I chose this is because it supports file export which is a very helpful feature and we are going to demonstrate how to use this feature in the demo section of this document.
